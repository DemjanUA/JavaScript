                        Our font directory places typography front and center, inviting users to explore, sort, and test fonts for use in more than 135 languages. We showcase individual type designers and foundries, giving you valuable information about the people and their processes, as well as analytics on usage and demographics. Our series of thematic collections helps you discover new fonts that have been vetted and organized by our team of designers, engineers, and collaborators, and our default sort organizes fonts based on popularity, trends, and your geographic location. You can also create your own highly customized collections by filtering families, weights, and scripts, plus test color themes, and review sample copy. Collections can be shared, making it easy to collaborate on projects and ensure typography is optimized and streamlined throughout the design and engineering process.

                        Printers used to print a bunch of pages and bind them into a book. Nowadays, we create a bunch of HTML files and link them together into a website. Learning HTML and CSS is a matter of understanding the available HTML markup and CSS rules to make a browser render those files exactly how they’re supposed to.

                    <p>
                        So, what is it to “learn” HTML and CSS? We like to look at it through a historical lens into the printing industry. Back in the days of the original printing press, printers created documents by arranging metal characters, dipping them in ink, and pressing them onto a piece of paper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a lot of ways, that’s exactly what web developers do, except instead of arranging moveable type, they write HTML and CSS. We’re concerned with the same task as they were: conveying content in meaningful ways. We even deal with the same presentational issues they did, like selecting the font to use, setting the size of headings, and determining the space between lines of text.
